       "[\"I bought the Phantom Black 512 GB variant of S22 Ultra. I pre-booked the device along with the Watch 4 offer. My net cost after all discounts and offers for the combo was Rs. 1.14 lakhs.RATINGS: OVERALL 9/10Camera: 10/10 (the best photography on a smartphone; for videos however, iPhone 13 Pro would be best though).Software: 9/10Display: 10/10Battery: 8/10Charging speed: 8/10Sound and Haptics: 7/10Performance: 9/10Features: 9/10Call quality: 8/10Heating: 10/10 (didn't see any heating issue with my limited use so far; haven't played games yet)Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner: 10/10 (it is impressively fast and accurate)Face Unlock: 9/10 (it is superfast in well lit environments, but doesn't work in dark environments)Here's my review after 2 days of use:CONS1. This is a 2 handed phone. It is big and you'll be uncomfortable using it with one hand. I wish the phone was slightly narrower and came with a grippy sandstone case.2. No pre-installed screen protector. I don't think you'll find a perfectly fitting screen protector either due to the curved edges.3. Battery life is just okay. I get about 5 to 6 hours SOT on a full charge.4. Charging speed is just okay. I bought the Samsung 45W Travel adapter and it takes about 1.5 hours to fully charge the device. This is pretty slow compared to what we see with OnePlus/ Xiaomi/ Oppo/ Vivo phones.5. No charger or earphones in the box. Only the phone and a Charging cable (tpye C to type C) is provided.6. Phantom White in 512 GB is not available in India (only 256 GB is available). I wanted it, but had to settle with the Black option. Some reviewers say that the Black variant gets scratched easily for some reason, so keep that in mind.7. OneUI doesn't use Material You theme of Android 12 in it's full glory. Some people may like it, some would prefer the stock Android feel as seen on Pixel and Motorola devices. It's not bad though, but just not a refreshing change. So putting it in CONS section.8. Status bar icons are not too customizable.9. Curved Display: This has no practical use. They only look good on marketing materials. When you are actually using the phone, there is absolutely no benefit. On the contrary, content gets bent at the edges and not great especially when watching videos or photos.PROS1. The best camera on a smartphone for photography. For videos however, iPhone 13 Pro is best. I bought this phone primarily for 2 reasons: the cameras, and the S-Pen which comes with it's own housing.2. S-Pen: Only phone with the pen feature.3. The best Display on a smartphone. I have kept the default FHD+ resolution (120 Hz adaptive refresh rate) just because there is hardly any difference you'll notice between FHD+ and WQHD+ on a small screen, and also because there is hardly any content that is of such high resolution. So I switched back to the default setting to prolong battery life.4. Feature rich software: This has both plus and minus points. Minus because more and more features means more chance of bugs and device slowing down due to bloatware. It also consumes battery. On the positive side, you can do a lot of things, although much of it is fancy, non-essential stuff.5. One handed use option (software feature) is very nice.6. Switching between light and dark themes is very smooth along with adaptive pallette selection.7. Phone has built-in call recording feature (atleast in India) without the stupid voice announcement.8. Performance is very good. No heating issues or throttling so far.9. This is the first time that Samsung has brought the Snapdragon chip model to India. Based on reviews, it is better than the Exynos variant just as in previous years.10. Both Face Unlock and under display ultrasonic Fingerprint scanner are SUPERFAST. Although in dark environments, face unlock struggles to unlock the phone. Using the Fingerprint is better in dark environments.I got two cases: Spigen Thin Fit and Caseology Parallex (a Spigen sub-brand). They fit perfectly, without adding bulk to the device.I haven't found a screen protector yet that would fit perfectly without bubbles at the edges.So that sums up my experience with the phone over 2 days of use. Hope this helps you with your choice of smartphone.EDIT: I had pre-booked the device on the 5th of March and it was delivered to me on the 17th of March, even though deliveries began on the 12th itself. My complaint is w.r.t the fact that the exact same variant was available with 1 day delivery to my pincode starting from the 12th. So anyone who ordered between 11th to 15th would have received their delivery within a day, earlier than me. This is unfair because seller has to service orders on a first-come-first-served basis. I can't accept someone ordering upto 10 days after me to get his order before me.But I will keep this in mind next time I want to pre-book on Amazon. When I enquired about it, customer service told me that I got it at a discount. That's a terrible explanation because there was no indication of that when I pre-booked the device. The offline stores were offering pretty much the same deal. Had I gone with an offline purchase, i would have got it much earlier for the same price, plus I need not have worried about the product getting damaged during transit. I mean I can inspect the box and make a decision before purchase at an offline store. The box I received had a few minor damages, although everything inside was fine.Expect delays in deliveries if you pre-book an item on Amazon, even if the item is in stock and available for delivery to your pincode by the same seller.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve always wanted to get a S Series flagship. I have always wanted to get a Note Series flagship. Now I have both of them in the S22 Ultra.After a long wait, Samsung finally merged the S and Note series which was inevitable and I am glad they did.The S22 Ultra is the phone to beat this year. Samsung launched the S series earlier than expected and we have already got a phone of the year contender 3 months into the year. Don\\'t think it gets any better than this no matter what flagship any competition introduces.Before this, I was using One Plus 7 Pro and the S22 Ultra makes it feel like a Xiaomi phone. I was not ready to be blown away considering that OP7P is a pretty good phone to begin with. But it improves on every aspect of a 2-3 year old flagship and this is Android at it\\'s peak (until Samsung comes out with another banger next year)It goes without saying that the camera on S22 Ultra is the highlight followed by the S-Pen. And the conversation cannot be considered over until we mention the 100x zoom. I am amazed every time I do comparison shots where I take a normal picture and then a 100x zoom and find a detail which is not possible to see with the naked eye. I\\'ll let you be the judge after going through the pictures I have uploaded (the pigeon vs the park).The display puts other mobile based OLED screens to shame. It is difficult to describe in words and you will have to see it for yourself, but the colors, sharpness of the text, adaptive refresh rate, QHD+ resolution is a sight to behold if you don\\'t care about the battery life (which I don\\'t) and I chose to not make any compromises with my experience of using this phone.The S-Pen which a lot of people have said to be a gimmick is a very nice addition and I find myself using it more often than not while browsing internet or simply watching YouTube. I really like the \"Smart Select\" feature which enables you to take screenshots and crop pictures on the fly. Definitely been using it a lot more than I should.There are a lot more detailed reviews out there which would tell you the specs and other features, but you probably don\\'t need to know all the technical aspects of it. All you need to know is this is a- Snapdragon version- Has an updated GPU (gaming performance has vastly improved if you are into mobile gaming)- S-Pen latency has vastly improved- 45W fast charging (get a charging brick from Samsung, or any reputed third party like Spigen)All in all, if money is not an object and you want a phone which provides an uncompromising experience. This is the way.',\n",
       " \"There no doubt that it one of the best Android smartphone you can buy, however it is the same size as my Redmi note 10 Pro Max but bulky, you need to be careful while using it in one hand as Screen is very fragile and there is no case or cover out there that can protect screen but only edges can be saved by a case.Now the operation is very smooth, camera is also good but you need to be more cautious and aware about the camera operation because it wont click nice picture automatically as you might have seen in reviews. So, there should be a little photographer inside you to produce good images, otherwise if you just start clicking pics randomly, you won't find it attractive at all, it will be very similar other normal smartphones, grainy and blurry and what not. So, keep that in mind, it can take good quality pictures and videos but you should know how to get it from this device. Best selfie camera in any phone I have ever seen, I wish they have done the same with rear camera as well, just open front camera and take a pick and it will hard to delete that as it will look great.Battery life is the weak point with this phone, won't last whole day if you are a heavy user. If you will use camera extensively then it will even lesser. 15 min of camera use will consume 15-20% of battery life and it will as well while using camera, specially while recording videos in 4K, you will feel it on top of cover as well, but it didn't hampered any operations yet (maybe throttling in the background, but not that much noticeable to user).Display is one the best you would find,  pleasure to watch anything on it, however I am not a gamer and didn't tried any game except candy crush.Due to the fact that it is very fragile I have bought 2 year comprehensive warranty for this that will over 1 damage to the phone each year for two years. (Cost-14K)Got it in 78K (approx. with no cost emi) during Diwali sale, for some reason as soon as Diwali sale was over, all of its covers prices hiked to double (Spigen etc).I would recommend it if you are a fan of bit phones, OneUI is still not that responsive as IOS or Pixcel phones. But does not lag too far from them. Hope this will help.\",\n",
       " \"Pre-Ordered it on 3rd March 2022.Received it as promised on 11th March alongwith the Galaxy Watch 4, 44mm.Had been using the One Plus flagships since 2017.Initially , I was skeptical about Samsung devices due to the bloatware and other issues.However, I decided to take the leap to this device after much deliberation and narrowed doewn to the iPhone 13 pro max and S22 Ultra.I already have the Tab S7Fe and am very happy with the performance.Coming to the smartphone, the device received was the phantom black 12gb ram,256 gb variant.Amazing finish and build quality.I found it to be a bit heavy and bulky initially,  but after a while, got used to it.It is a large device and not advisable for people with small hands.I would like to break up my review in two parts.Pros and Cons.Pros:1. Amazing performance from the SD 8Gen1 chipset.No lags or glitches whatsoever. A true flagship with industry leading processing power. The RAM plus feature is good.2. Amazing battery life. - some people will complain about mediocre battery life. But I have had no issues so far. The battery needs to optimise the apps. And after about 1 week of use and 2 updates later, the battery performance has improved. Getting almost 2 days of battery life with the 120hz adaptive mode and QHD+ resolution always on.3. Stunning display.-Samsung has always been the unbeaten champion of display tech and has once again nailed it with this QHD+ display.The colour reproduction and accuracy is immaculate and precise. The superbright screen is easily readable in direct sunlight and no screen bleeding or inconsistent color observed.The adaptive brightness works flawlessly.4. Virtual RAM works wonders. The already adequate 12 gb of ram is complemented by the virtual ram feature and is a boon for multi tasking and gaming.5. S-Pen features. I have always been a die-hard fan of the S-pen and have craved to use a flagship device having the feature for my daily work and gaming use. The S-pen is very useful in jotting down notes,as a magnifier, as a doodle, as a selfie stick and adds to the convenience.6.Super versatile camera performance.The camera performance is absolutely spot on.Be it point and shoot, portrait mode ,selfie, video recording, pro-mode or the slow motion shooting,Bring it on. The versatility offered is unbelievable. Apple needs to upgrade from the 12 mp hardware and learn to deliver better hardware in lieu of tweaking the image post capture like Samsung. Details captured and the stunning portraits are proof of Samsung image processing with optimised hardware and software experience.7. Valie for money and bang for your buck.I pre ordered the S22 Ultra and the Galaxy Watch4, 44mm and got a very good deal on Amazon for ₹.1.08 lakhs.Had I opted for the apple ecosystem,  the total cost would have gone up to ₹.1.50 lakhs.The Galaxy ecosystem is evolving and the level of customisation is wat better than iOS ecosystem, although there is a huge scope of improvement.8. Samsung updates: I was concerned about the android updates as Samsung was notorious for non-updation of their old flagships. However, I was relieved to find out that Samsung has promised 4 years of updates. So that is a real peace of mind. And my device has already received 2 software ,firmware and security patch updates via OTA.Cons:1. One UI. The most irritating part is Non availability of Google voice assistant. Everytime I try to use the voice assistant,  the Bixby routine assistant is prompted. Samsung must go ahead and drop it's Bixby assistant which is not as optimised and versatile as Google assistant.2. Curved screen. In a way the screen is immaculate and accidental touches are avoided if we switch on the accidental touch option. But curved screens are a headache and prone to accidental touches. I so miss the flat screen on my One Plus 7T.3. App drawer horizontal navigation.The app drawer just cannot be modified to scroll vertically. I downloaded the good lock app and the home up drawer customisation is not up to the mark. Samsung needs to optimise this.4. The Galaxy app store needs to be synchronized with Google Play store so that unnecessary pop-ups and useless apps are not recommended.5. Heavy animations consume battery life and need to be disabled manually.6. Option of 4k video @30fps needs to be enabled manually.All said and done, I am fully satisfied with my purchase and I must thank Samsung for making this amazing device as a combination of the note and s series and also kudos to Amazon for facilitating my purchase.Thanks and regards.\",\n",
       " \"I have had my relationship broken with Samsung 12 years ago because of the unethical behaviour of their service center staff. The staff broke my phone after an argument when they were not able to fix an issue in the new phone even after 3 visits. And, Samsung did nothing even after filing a complaint.In last 12 years I have used 14 major flagship devices from different companies. But didn't bought any Samsung goods.Today, after 12 years I dicided to give second and last chance to Samsung. Pre-booked this phone. Hope this will be good experience now.Here is my observation after using this device a few days.Pros:1. Awesome build quality.2. Camera (and zoom) is next level3. Speakers are loud with quality sound.4. Good network modem. My iPhone 13 struggles to get network coverage inside the home but there are full signals in Samsung phone from the same network operator.5. S pen is great addition to the S series and it works really well and fast.6. Display is really smooth and awesome7. Very touch sensitive.8. One UI seems to be promising.9. And finally, it does include the Snapdragon processor in India unit this time instead their inferior Exynos processor which helps in improving battery life and image processing.Cons:1. Doesn't come up with charging adapter. In the name of environment they fool customers to buy chargers saperately to make some extra bucks.2. Having a case inside box would have been nice like OnePlus provides one.3. There was no screen protector applied to tne display. So if you want to protect screen from the day 1, buy 1 screen protector along with the phone.4. Slower than last gen OnePlus 9 pro (12GB - 256GB). I compared keeping them side by side and disappointed by the Samsung in terms of App installation speed and gaming performance.\",\n",

Excellent display in low light and bright light conditions. Never used a phone that is as bright as this2. Camera - I'm neither a professional photographer nor a rookie but i can simply say this is by far the best smartphone with ultrawide, portrait and zoom capabilities in any android phone.3. Battery life - When using the adaptive refresh rate with WQHD display settings the battery lasted for a day and it still gave me 15 % while logging off the day. But when it comes to FULL HD and standard refresh rate, it's Massive. I'm getting more than two days of battery life. If you are not a gamer or not a content creator, then using the phone in second setting you should be amazed with the battery life.That's all I have to describe about this phone. Some may think of this review as biased, but believe me when i say this. No product is perfect, this also has some drawbacks but they don't make this product go down because the positives just make it worth buying.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ve always wanted to get a S Series flagship. I have always wanted to get a Note Series flagship. Now I have both of them in the S22 Ultra.After a long wait, Samsung finally merged the S and Note series which was inevitable and I am glad they did.The S22 Ultra is the phone to beat this year. Samsung launched the S series earlier than expected and we have already got a phone of the year contender 3 months into the year. Don\\'t think it gets any better than this no matter what flagship any competition introduces.Before this, I was using One Plus 7 Pro and the S22 Ultra makes it feel like a Xiaomi phone. I was not ready to be blown away considering that OP7P is a pretty good phone to begin with. But it improves on every aspect of a 2-3 year old flagship and this is Android at it\\'s peak (until Samsung comes out with another banger next year)It goes without saying that the camera on S22 Ultra is the highlight followed by the S-Pen. And the conversation cannot be considered over until we mention the 100x zoom. I am amazed every time I do comparison shots where I take a normal picture and then a 100x zoom and find a detail which is not possible to see with the naked eye. I\\'ll let you be the judge after going through the pictures I have uploaded (the pigeon vs the park).The display puts other mobile based OLED screens to shame. It is difficult to describe in words and you will have to see it for yourself, but the colors, sharpness of the text, adaptive refresh rate, QHD+ resolution is a sight to behold if you don\\'t care about the battery life (which I don\\'t) and I chose to not make any compromises with my experience of using this phone.The S-Pen which a lot of people have said to be a gimmick is a very nice addition and I find myself using it more often than not while browsing internet or simply watching YouTube. I really like the \"Smart Select\" feature which enables you to take screenshots and crop pictures on the fly. Definitely been using it a lot more than I should.There are a lot more detailed reviews out there which would tell you the specs and other features, but you probably don\\'t need to know all the technical aspects of it. All you need to know is this is a- Snapdragon version- Has an updated GPU (gaming performance has vastly improved if you are into mobile gaming)- S-Pen latency has vastly improved- 45W fast charging (get a charging brick from Samsung, or any reputed third party like Spigen)All in all, if money is not an object and you want a phone which provides an uncompromising experience. This is the way.',\n",
       " \"There no doubt that it one of the best Android smartphone you can buy, however it is the same size as my Redmi note 10 Pro Max but bulky, you need to be careful while using it in one hand as Screen is very fragile and there is no case or cover out there that can protect screen but only edges can be saved by a case.Now the operation is very smooth, camera is also good but you need to be more cautious and aware about the camera operation because it wont click nice picture automatically as you might have seen in reviews. So, there should be a little photographer inside you to produce good images, otherwise if you just start clicking pics randomly, you won't find it attractive at all, it will be very similar other normal smartphones, grainy and blurry and what not. So, keep that in mind, it can take good quality pictures and videos but you should know how to get it from this device. Best selfie camera in any phone I have ever seen, I wish they have done the same with rear camera as well, just open front camera and take a pick and it will hard to delete that as it will look great.Battery life is the weak point with this phone, won't last whole day if you are a heavy user. If you will use camera extensively then it will even lesser. 15 min of camera use will consume 15-20% of battery life and it will as well while using camera, specially while recording videos in 4K, you will feel it on top of cover as well, but it didn't hampered any operations yet (maybe throttling in the background, but not that much noticeable to user).Display is one the best you would find,  pleasure to watch anything on it, however I am not a gamer and didn't tried any game except candy crush.Due to the fact that it is very fragile I have bought 2 year comprehensive warranty for this that will over 1 damage to the phone each year for two years. (Cost-14K)Got it in 78K (approx. with no cost emi) during Diwali sale, for some reason as soon as Diwali sale was over, all of its covers prices hiked to double (Spigen etc).I would recommend it if you are a fan of bit phones, OneUI is still not that responsive as IOS or Pixcel phones. But does not lag too far from them. Hope this will help.\",\n",
       " \"Pre-Ordered it on 3rd March 2022.Received it as promised on 11th March alongwith the Galaxy Watch 4, 44mm.Had been using the One Plus flagships since 2017.Initially , I was skeptical about Samsung devices due to the bloatware and other issues.However, I decided to take the leap to this device after much deliberation and narrowed doewn to the iPhone 13 pro max and S22 Ultra.I already have the Tab S7Fe and am very happy with the performance.Coming to the smartphone, the device received was the phantom black 12gb ram,256 gb variant.Amazing finish and build quality.I found it to be a bit heavy and bulky initially,  but after a while, got used to it.It is a large device and not advisable for people with small hands.I would like to break up my review in two parts.Pros and Cons.Pros:1. Amazing performance from the SD 8Gen1 chipset.No lags or glitches whatsoever. A true flagship with industry leading processing power. The RAM plus feature is good.2. Amazing battery life. - some people will complain about mediocre battery life. But I have had no issues so far. The battery needs to optimise the apps. And after about 1 week of use and 2 updates later, the battery performance has improved. Getting almost 2 days of battery life with the 120hz adaptive mode and QHD+ resolution always on.3. Stunning display.-Samsung has always been the unbeaten champion of display tech and has once again nailed it with this QHD+ display.The colour reproduction and accuracy is immaculate and precise. The superbright screen is easily readable in direct sunlight and no screen bleeding or inconsistent color observed.The adaptive brightness works flawlessly.4. Virtual RAM works wonders. The already adequate 12 gb of ram is complemented by the virtual ram feature and is a boon for multi tasking and gaming.5. S-Pen features. I have always been a die-hard fan of the S-pen and have craved to use a flagship device having the feature for my daily work and gaming use. The S-pen is very useful in jotting down notes,as a magnifier, as a doodle, as a selfie stick and adds to the convenience.6.Super versatile camera performance.The camera performance is absolutely spot on.Be it point and shoot, portrait mode ,selfie, video recording, pro-mode or the slow motion shooting,Bring it on. The versatility offered is unbelievable. Apple needs to upgrade from the 12 mp hardware and learn to deliver better hardware in lieu of tweaking the image post capture like Samsung. Details captured and the stunning portraits are proof of Samsung image processing with optimised hardware and software experience.7. Valie for money and bang for your buck.I pre ordered the S22 Ultra and the Galaxy Watch4, 44mm and got a very good deal on Amazon for ₹.1.08 lakhs.Had I opted for the apple ecosystem,  the total cost would have gone up to ₹.1.50 lakhs.The Galaxy ecosystem is evolving and the level of customisation is wat better than iOS ecosystem, although there is a huge scope of improvement.8. Samsung updates: I was concerned about the android updates as Samsung was notorious for non-updation of their old flagships. However, I was relieved to find out that Samsung has promised 4 years of updates. So that is a real peace of mind. And my device has already received 2 software ,firmware and security patch updates via OTA.Cons:1. One UI. The most irritating part is Non availability of Google voice assistant. Everytime I try to use the voice assistant,  the Bixby routine assistant is prompted. Samsung must go ahead and drop it's Bixby assistant which is not as optimised and versatile as Google assistant.2. Curved screen. In a way the screen is immaculate and accidental touches are avoided if we switch on the accidental touch option. But curved screens are a headache and prone to accidental touches. I so miss the flat screen on my One Plus 7T.3. App drawer horizontal navigation.The app drawer just cannot be modified to scroll vertically. I downloaded the good lock app and the home up drawer customisation is not up to the mark. Samsung needs to optimise this.4. The Galaxy app store needs to be synchronized with Google Play store so that unnecessary pop-ups and useless apps are not recommended.5. Heavy animations consume battery life and need to be disabled manually.6. Option of 4k video @30fps needs to be enabled manually.All said and done, I am fully satisfied with my purchase and I must thank Samsung for making this amazing device as a combination of the note and s series and also kudos to Amazon for facilitating my purchase.Thanks and regards.\",\n",
       " \"I have had my relationship broken with Samsung 12 years ago because of the unethical behaviour of their service center staff. The staff broke my phone after an argument when they were not able to fix an issue in the new phone even after 3 visits. And, Samsung did nothing even after filing a complaint.In last 12 years I have used 14 major flagship devices from different companies. But didn't bought any Samsung goods.Today, after 12 years I dicided to give second and last chance to Samsung. Pre-booked this phone. Hope this will be good experience now.Here is my observation after using this device a few days.Pros:1. Awesome build quality.2. Camera (and zoom) is next level3. Speakers are loud with quality sound.4. Good network modem. My iPhone 13 struggles to get network coverage inside the home but there are full signals in Samsung phone from the same network operator.5. S pen is great addition to the S series and it works really well and fast.6. Display is really smooth and awesome7. Very touch sensitive.8. One UI seems to be promising.9. And finally, it does include the Snapdragon processor in India unit this time instead their inferior Exynos processor which helps in improving battery life and image processing.Cons:1. Doesn't come up with charging adapter. In the name of environment they fool customers to buy chargers saperately to make some extra bucks.2. Having a case inside box would have been nice like OnePlus provides one.3. There was no screen protector applied to tne display. So if you want to protect screen from the day 1, buy 1 screen protector along with the phone.4. Slower than last gen OnePlus 9 pro (12GB - 256GB). I compared keeping them side by side and disappointed by the Samsung in terms of App installation speed and gaming performance.\",\n",

Excellent display in low light and bright light conditions. Never used a phone that is as bright as this2. Camera - I'm neither a professional photographer nor a rookie but i can simply say this is by far the best smartphone with ultrawide, portrait and zoom capabilities in any android phone.3. Battery life - When using the adaptive refresh rate with WQHD display settings the battery lasted for a day and it still gave me 15 % while logging off the day. But when it comes to FULL HD and standard refresh rate, it's Massive. I'm getting more than two days of battery life. If you are not a gamer or not a content creator, then using the phone in second setting you should be amazed with the battery life.That's all I have to describe about this phone. Some may think of this review as biased, but believe me when i say this. No product is perfect, this also has some drawbacks but they don't make this product go down because the positives just make it worth buying.\",\n",

It's so.... feature rich that most of the users may not be able to take full advantage of all the features of this phone. Cameras are amazing and at par with the flagship iPhone or sometimes even better than the best iPhone available now. Battery life is good when used in 2K mode (6 and a half hours screen on time) and exceptional when used in FHD mode (around 8 and a half hours).It's really a smart phone due to it's highly intuitive smart features.However, no phone is made perfect and this S22 Ultra is no exception.The main issue is with the finger print scanner which just sucks. It works 4 times out 10 attempts. Face ID struggles to identify the face and doesn't work at all under low light conditions. So the best way to unlock the phone is to use a password or the pattern. This is not expected out of a flagship phone.They don't provide the S-Pen tips with this Phone (as they used to provide with older Samsung Note series phones earlier). The feel of the S-Pen tip is not as good (it's not as smooth) as it used to be with the older models, though the response time is much much better & instantaneous.If you are looking for an Android Phone then this is the best (even better than pixel 7 pro) phone in the market as of now.

       " 'In this time of 1 month of owning this killer beast of a phone, one thing I can say I spent my hard-earned money well. Never used a phone like this, and the maximum flagship experience is with a device with Snapdragon 855 based LG G8X ThinQ. This device is of a different league. Managed to have a taste of iPhone 13 Pro Max 256 GB from a \"Baron\" friend but in comparison to that this is also head-to-head and if not more. The user friendliness is of different level. Never thought a phone can be this productive with its software suite. I will not delve into the details of this phone as others already have. But I happen to own the Sony WF1000 XM3 & Sony WF1000XM4 both of which just blow away with the details of music when paired with this phone. It\\'s Dolby Atmos speakers also try to produce a spatial sound experience (somewhat) definitely not heard before by my ears from any phone.

       " \"UPDATED : -I was skeptical at first as the Amazon packaging was closed but Samsung packaging seal was opened at first but still used the same model and later found somewhat heating issues of the phone with little bit of throttling in first few days but later the AI/ Machine Learning worked pretty good and after the phone learnt my usage patterns it worked and optimized pretty well.  I had waited for the package and grabbed it when the green one stock came back and that too with exchange I got it for around 89k. Quite happy and satisfied.Anyways, as my model was in replacement period I thought of replacing it with a model that is not yet opened and with it's box seal still intact. Hence, later I received the new model two days back and it was totally sealed and new as well. Now the main question was to check and compare the performances of both the models and I found the following : -Old Phone (seal broken)  vs  New Phone (seal intact)-it heated easily under load  There was min of 2-3 C-max benchmark unlimited stress test  It gave even without AI optimization (36 to 42)temp -> 38 to 44 C ( 42-43 after the AI has optimized)  It cooled down faster than the old one.SO I am very happy that I am enjoying a newly sealed phone. The seller did a great job as well. I would recommend you guys to go for replacement or return in order to get a fresh close sealed phone as you are paying a huge sum of money.Now the PROS and CONS (after almost using it for 2 to 3 weeks):-Pros--Great camera quality.  -CAMERA - 10/10-Nice build quality  -  -STYLE  and DESIGN - 10/10  -S-PEN 10/10  -BATTERY  - 9/10-The metallic body feels premium to touch-S-pen notes , calculations, sketches and rough work is fun and handy too.- this color beats other burgundy or black option but it's completely your choice.-fast UI and overall free ram of over 5 GB lefts and that's great to a extent.- The AI is super fast in understanding your usage pattern and hence gives better battery backup and maintains core temperature of phone as well. (AI = 10/10)Cons (not a big deal though) --The phone can be little bit bulky to hold after putting the Spigen cover.- because of the metal body , can heat to a degree of 37 degree to 40 when under too much load.

Unbeatable performance7. Jumbo battery with good backup8. Zoom - Ultimately Unbeatable zoom features (Upto 100x, just wow)9. Jumbo internal memory, no need to external memory card.10. 12 GB RAM is providing awesome experience.11. Latest powerfully processor12. Power sharing is one of the best features.13. Wireless charging is a cool feature. However it is not easy to handle. Cable charging option is better than this.14. Touch response is good.15. Better than iPhoneCons:1. Heavy design, you can not control it by one hand, could be better, sleek and light weight.2. Extra big screen, Samsung should provide such feature and design in small screen,  5-6 inches.3. Face reader - not beating iPhone, iPhone has super speedy and accurate face reader even in the night. So I am disappointed on this point.4. Horrible Finger print scanner - Too bad experience with it. Even oppo, vivo phone worth rs 20000 are having far far better finger print reading than this phone. So I decided to use pin lock only.5. No charger or earphones in the box, This is really a worst part of these costly phones. I hate it.6. I miss auto power off/on feature in this device. I love that feature to make the phone cool.7. If Samsung provide a date time, location and static text timestamp on the images captured by the camera, that would be a cool feature.8. Phone and features does not justify RS. 1,00,000 . Too much costly.Overall, this is a beautiful, Strong, Fast, Smooth, features loaded phone. I recommend it if you are fade up from iPhone. Not for general users. Business use mobile.Review after 2 Months -Cutting one star from the rating because it heats too much if you take many pictures and says its too hot you can not take more pictures. Then I had to put it in front of my car's ac vents to cool it for 15 minutes. So I missed valuable moment capture in that time by this phone. Luckily I was having iPhone too. And Samsung is claiming they put extras heating protection in it. It is not beating iPhone on that point. iPhone doesn't not heat even after heavy use.\",\n",

       " 'The phone is a beast no questions asked. It worth the every penny you spend. Everything is above the scale:- fast, Snappy.Design is what stood out the most for me though its not much of a difference from it predeccssor still its feels out of the box to hold.Performance is as it should be, best in the game, With Snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor there is alot of a talk about heating however there is no such case with this phone. No matter how heavy user you are or how intense gaming you do this phone handles it all with a ease.Camera:- When i purchased this phone i was really looking forward to experience the camera it offers, If you compare this with best in market iphone 13 pro max, then you wont be disappointed, it offers similar camera quality or in some conditions even better. The dynamic range, saturation, portrait shots all are excellenet in day light. Its nightography function is also extremely good. Talking about video capabilities it offers 8k at 30fps and all other similar in market, its VDIS and OIS feature does make your video rich, steady with prefect light balance. Just like its predecssor this also offers superzoom 100x But all i can add is till 30x its perfectly good after that samsung needs to work on it. Perhaps in next 4-5 years we might be able to have 100x as clear as 30x zoom feature.S Pen:- latency has been reduced to 2.8s which is the super best i can say and also the air gestures is quite fun to use and you can do quite alot with your spen like signing your pdf document on your phone itself without worrying about to get a copy and then signing it.  Using S pen also gets the premium vibe to you in day to day uses it feels bossy.Battery life:- its Good can be better on day to day heavy uses it gets 7-8 hours of screen on time which i feel is already good but its competitor 13 pro max has much better battery compare to it. That generally offers 10 -11 hours of uses which is insane. I would ask samsung to focus on its battery this will generally lead to out perform even apple.Everything else is the best no competition design, performance, One UI, camera, S pen and display. This is phone of the year',\n",

Battery life is average just getting 5hours screen on time even though I have kept the screen resolution to HD and power savings mode \"ON\".The main negative I found is heating issue, just by browsing, checking WhatsApp, Insta the phone is getting hot, that is so pathetic. Camera is good, zoom feature is ok, don\\'t expert any DSLR clarity with it, to be honest I\\'m disappointed with the clarity, by seeing the reviews in youtube I expected a super crip image quality, Naaaa.. it\\'s not there. I really dont agree with the NIGHTOGRAPHY of samsung, the phone at all performing well in the less light ambience, it create so much noise in the picture. And yeah, inspite that samsung says it has AI stuff, the picture comes blurry even with slightest movement of the subject.Display is good, it is bright and vivid and super smooth, no complaints with display at all.Sound is decent, keeping the Atmos mode on, really succeed in creating some surround effects.Spen is just take the phone into more productive level. This is one of the key feature I brought this expensive phone.From the past 8 years I\\'m only using Galaxy note series phone. Anyway the final statement is, Overall it is a good phone but I really don\\'t think it\\'s price worthy. Paid 1.12 lakh for the phone (including watch) it is really not justified this high price tag.Display, camera and sPen are the main catch of this phone, rest all are offered features are included even in phone below 30k price range (including 8Gen 1 chip set)To be honest, not that much satisfied with the phone!',\n",

But OS smoothness is not that good compared to OnePlus's Oxygen OS. Apps download and installation takes a lot of time when compared to iPhone and OnePlus.There have been several events where I found apps close down automatically when you start using them. Maybe a software update might help on this. There have been events where the phone has lagged as well.Earlier I had OnePlus 7T Pro 2 years back and that phone was damn smooth and never did it lag at all not did any of the apps crashed u like Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.These were few instances where this phone has disappointed me quite a bit. All these issues can be resolved via software update. So hoping Samsung team might look into it and do the needful.Design is stunning and so is the S Pen.This phone has great aesthetics of how a super phone design should be. Now my mom uses my OnePlus 7T Pro phone and occasionally when I use it, it's too fast even being on Android 11. So, come on Samsung and fix the bugs. We have put so much of trust and money in this phone so we deserve the best experience from the phone of such a name.Rest, I will update my review after I get an OS update to see if the bugs are removed.Thanks!\",\n",

RAM is pretty much occupied by system but I didn't found any issue while day to day use, and ain't a heavy user as well so can't comment about gaming performance.Battery: it doesn't feel like 5000 mah. Need to charge every morning, sometimes before sleeping at night. Hope Samsung fix it by software update.Camera:Tuning of camera is done very accurately by Samsung. Color levels, exposure, HDR..everything feels perfect. Zoom is extraordinary and perfectly usable till 30x-50x. Still haven't got opportunity for testing the camera in different environments, will update later for that.Accessories:I have applied Spigen screen protector on screen so fingerprint reader is working same as on naked screen, and S-Pen is also working fine I would say (Not smooth as on glass, but perfectly usable).Spigen Liquid Air cover is just perfect to hold the S22 ultra, as it provides extra grip on the sides.Even though it's costlier, I would recommend to buy who has budget for this ULTRA flagship.

I was not a big fan of the Apple's walled Garden approach to their ecosystem and not a big fan of iOS either but during a short period of use i really liked the iPhone 13Pro. But i loved the Android, its flexibility and Samsungs extremely customizable One UI. So i took a leap of faith and pre-ordered the Ultra. And until now from the minute i unboxed this beast of a Phone (the charger situation aside), it never disappointed me. Perfomace is superb, cameras are outstanding, low light performance of the cameras are out of the world. Battery life is more than enough. One UI is beautiful , fluent and buttery smooth. Speakers are fantastic. I did not find any issue of overheating even after heavy sessions of gaming. But the phone gets a little warm. Thats all. Okay...! Now some of the Cons1. I am coming from a OnePlus 6, and when comparing with that phone, this one is heavy.2. Some pre-installed Samsung apps have all the permissions and notifications allowed which we cant change, uninstall or disable.3. When it comes to Video recording, Samsung still cant beat its Notched Rivals. They still outclass the Ultra by a huge margin.4. Another annoying thing. Long press of the power button wakes Bixby up by default. Although we can disable bixby, samsung wont allow us to set it to summon the Google assistant.If samsung keeps its promise of 4 years of major updates and 5 years of security patches for its top end phones, one can use this phone for more that 3 years easily if you have a habbit of holding on to a phone for that long.

S Pen is more responsive, as Samsung made it 70% faster with less latency.Galaxy S22 Ultra's biggest upgrades come with its cameras, as Samsung is shooting to overtake the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Google Pixel 6 Pro as the best camera phone.Key features I love:Best phone display yet: The Galaxy S22 Ultra's AMOLED panel is not only brighter than the competition, making it ideal for outdoor viewing, it delivers better color saturation.The S Pen is better: By reducing the latency by 70%, writing and drawing on the Galaxy S22 Ultra feels as smooth as pen and paper. And there's a holster built in.Better photos (especially in low light): Thanks to a bigger main sensor, the Galaxy S22 Ultra delivers brighter pictures than the S21 Ultra, and the Night Mode works even better than the iPhone 13 Pro Max in certain scenarios.Longer support: Samsung is promising five years of update support and four years of major OS updates, so this flagship should be able to last you a long time.Sleek and durable design: The Galaxy S22 Ultra is protected by an armor aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus+ back, and yet it's lighter than the iPhone 13 Pro Max without a lame notch.

This device the Galaxy S22 ultra is a beast. Okay now people would say is it faster than A15 bionic soc of apple? So you living in 2022 and still think an average smartphone cant do tasks of an average customer. We are almost reaching a point where smartphone processors permormace no longer matters in real time and also i doubt that apple is making even 50% use of the A15 in their iphone 13 lineup and theorotically A15 is faster than a ps4 pro so are you playing Red dead redemption 2 on iphone 13 ? And also no proper multitasking, simistic UI, close ended. Coming to the S22 ultra powered by snapdragon 8 gen 1. Ive been using couple of weeks now, its phenomenal it performs all the task like a piece of cake paired by adaptive 120hz refresh rate my experience is a lot lot smoother. Performance in simple terms is solid. Camera absolutely at flagship level and lets not forget the 100x space zoom and nightography by samsung. The s pen with 2.8 ms of latency is basically more or less realtime to me. You feel like properly writing on a paper. The only down part i have with the s22 ultra is the battery. 5000 mah sounds good but nowhere near the 13 pro max. Overall a beast phone. Worth buy. Cheers!',\n",

OnePlus was The Brand for rational folks like me. Made absolute sense. But obv with the current trend of OP, them be goin down! I had to switch.Was extremely sceptic and i had good reason. I was right in being so.I knew the OS would be the biggest miss and yeah, Oxygen vs OneUi, oxygen whopps butts. I was a bit depressed  when i started using s22 ultra. Samsung OS sucks. The customizability on O2 is mind boggling. Like the saying, you never truly know something until it's gone. OneUI, i have to install 3rd party apps who has access to my phone stuff to make it work even just a little closer to what oxygen offers by default. The stuffs which are missing are mind numbingly bad.Camera shutter sound can't be turned off??No battery optimised charging? What! OS sucks.No lock screen gestures.No auto screen wake when notification receive.Alert slider :(The new op10pro is absurd, but comparing this phone with my 3yo op7pro, mahn oh mahn that phone rocked.This phone isn't a phone. It's a brick. Heavy, a Mammoth. Impossible to hold in one hand. Hate the camera bumps stickin out(setup looks very cool. I dig). Accessories are ultra expensive. 45w charger is a comedy. OS sucks. Charging is slow.Don't get me wrong, one UI has some pretty amazing features but overall UI fades when compared to O2 UI. I badly miss my oxygen os.Where this phone has a huuuge lead is the hardware(even when compared to op10pro). This is a beast. Lighting speeds (when you have turned off animations). Camera and display is pure gold. Has heating issues but im sure they will fix it with future updates. Battery is 1 day ++ even with my battery care 85% charge limit, still I'm left with 30% battery eod(not a heavy user).Given a chance to redo, without a doubt would go for s22 ultra. Op10pro settled, big time.Idk why one UI is so restrictive and limited like i can't even turn off the VoLTE logo on the status bar or display live data bandwidth speeds. That's one thing i never liked about these top brands. For F's sake, op8pro had launched x-ray cam which could see through innerwears lol. Anyway, gone are those freedom days.I feel like those overpaid overworked corporate slaves while using this phone.I sincerely have mixed feelings with this phone. OS, feel like smashing the phone as hard as possible against the hardest surface. But Hardware is🥇🥇🥇\",\n",
       " \"IntroductionThe Samsung S22 Ultra is a Galaxy Note and as such, looks like a Note. In fact it's a more than perfect Note. It does everything a Note would do and even has a recessed pen! A Note person's wildest dream come true. In addition, unlike most Notes, this one has one of the best cameras you'll find in any flagship phone and great features.StylingWhile the looks... shape, proportions, colours etc are subjective, the edges are not pretty. Nor are the sharp corners. The edges could have been chrome or brushed steel. Instead, they are a glossy version of the colour, that looks painted and cheap. There is no camera bump, which some may like but it looks naked and cost effective to me. Also, the camera edges are dust traps. Once in a case, this looks more than fine but at that price, one could expect a better finish. The pen has been allowed to dictate the shape... curved sides and flat at the top and bottom. And the resultant sharp edges where they meet.PerformanceThe S22 Ultra is fast and smooth too, but It gets very hot with use. Not warm, hot! The S21 looks much better and doubles as a Note too. This one is not really a successor so the name is a mystery. Or is it just Samsung killing two birds with one stone?At it's core is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 which powers every 2022 flagship available in India right now. While it is fast, it does get hot with use which is not ideal, especially when you need to put it to your ear! Cooling this one is no small task and Samsung haven't managed to do it for sure. The case could keep your hand cool but the screen gets very hot too.The Camera is where it really scores over almost every other Android phone. It's better than all I've seen except the Pixel but it has a a wider ultrawide (slightly distorted) and macro focusing too. There's a pretty amazing sensor, a very powerful 10X Zoom lens and great camera software. The S22U tends to over sharpen images but this could be fixed later with the right software update yet it may not. The way it is now may be more popular, as at present, it's an excellent click and post. There is shadow noise but only if you zoom in.The Pen doubles as a remote shutter release (and can even control other camera functions like a magic wand!) which is very cool for Pros / tripod photos and selfies and group shots! I could take a selfie with the rear cameras by remote trigger! Likewise a group shot and not be limited to the selfie cam. It has a good range.ConclusionIf you want a premium Note with a pen, well look no further, this is as good as that gets. The recessed pen makes the display broader but that's absolutely fine... it even has it's advantages. The pixel pitch is imperceptibly less but 16:9 fills the screen better than the longer / wider format.The price obviously includes the pen which makes it more bearable. As of now, at their showrooms, Samsung are offering their Watch 4 (MRP ₹29K) at ₹3000 with the phone which is a great offer. If however, you don't need a watch, then it's expensive, at ₹105,000. If you can wait, when sales slow down, you will get it for ₹92K. (If you look hard enough, even now.) At ₹92K, it's a very good buy, it's features are cutting edge!The S22 Ultra is the best Note till date with an excellent camera to boot. If you like the looks, the shape and the metallic finish, just buy it already. It's fully worth the premium price. Never forget, Samsung are counting on the fact that the iPhone 13 Pro Max costs a lot more!_\",\n",

I had a horrible experience in the past two weeks with Samsung and suggest anyone who read this incident not to go with any samsung flagship product as they are incapable of handling such situations and they dont follow any ethical proceduresNow I have got call from CEO office that they are incapable of providing me any resolution and if I need to pay charges to get my phone repaired as it is now out of warranty.Extremly pathetic and irresponsible brandPlease use your hard earned money wisely.Mine 109k got drained away.\",\n",

Supervisor/Manager was also not available for better solution, requested to call me back when they are available but didn\\'t received any call.

Everything feels buttery smooth.The fastest phone out there till now is undoubtedly this phone.Guys go for 512 GB variant because there is not much difference in price between the 256 and 512 variant and u will not regret.The thing I most like is the speed which is just omg!.I am a old Samsung customer and will never switch to iPhone, at least not for now.I tried all its features and in no department its lagging.Guys this is the best from Samsung yet so buy without hesitation. Good luck who are upgrading like me.',\n",
